rCTF is redpwnCTF's CTF platform. It is developed and maintained by the [redpwn](https://redpwn.net) CTF team.

## Getting Started

To get started with rCTF, visit the docs at [rctf.redpwn.net](https://rctf.redpwn.net/installation/)

## Deploying Challenges with rCTF

rCTF itself does not handle challenge deployments.

Optionally, you can use [rCDS](https://github.com/redpwn/rcds) to deploy challenges. It is heavily integrated with rCTF.

## Development

We would love your help! Please see [our CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
